## About 

Hi! :wave: Welcome to the NetViz project! This project aims at building an interactive dashboard for :clapper:[Netflix movies data](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows). Further details can be found in our [proposal](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/netviz/blob/main/doc/proposal.md) document. The dashboard can be accessed from [here](link to deployed dashboard **TODO**).

## Description & sketch
**TODO based on actual dashboard**

The dashboard provides some summarized information on Netflix movies given by the chosen genre, type and duration. It contains a world map showing the distribution of Netflix movies with color-coded scheme indicating the amount of movies produced in each country/region. From a dropdown list, users can filter out genres from the display distribution, by years, by location (i.e. the country where they are produced), and by the frequencies of their ratings. Detailed information of the (sampled) individual movies would be shown in a table in the dashboard as well, giving users more information on selection of movies. From the radio button, users can select to see movies that are on Netflix. The sliding bar allows users to filter on the duration of the movie and different plots and results would be reflecting the filtered results. The table of detailed information on the individual movies will also be included for reference, in case the users would like to check out their favorite movies of the specific genre are there. The rating plot would give out information on the distribution of each rating type of the selected/filtered movies.

Here is a sketch of the dashboard design:
