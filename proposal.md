# Motivation and Purpose

# Description of the data
We will be visualizing a dataset of approximately 8,800 movies or TV shows on Netflix. In this dataset, 70% of the items are movies and 30% are TV shows, which were added on Netflix from 2008 to 2021. Other than the unique identifier column (`show_id`), each row of record has 11 associated variables that describes the movie or TV show. These variables include movie or TV show identifier (`type`), basic information about the movie or TV show (`title`, `director`, `cast`, `country`, `release_year`, `duration`), date that the movie or TV show was added on Netflix (`date_added`), genre (`listed_in`), rating score on Netflix (`rating`), and a pure text summary column about the movie or TV show (`description`).
